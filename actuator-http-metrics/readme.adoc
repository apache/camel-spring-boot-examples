== Camel with Actuator - Mappings, Metrics and Shutdown example

This example shows how you can query some of Spring Boot Actuator options from your
Camel routes.

=== How to run

[source,console]
----
mvn compile spring-boot:run
----

=== Actuator routes

You need to enable the HTTP routes on Actuator to be able to use them. For example,
in this example we have to expose the metrics, mappings and shutdown routes.

[source, properties]
----
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=mappings,metrics,shutdown
----

You can see other functionalities and more details in
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-endpoints-enabling-endpoints[Actuator's documentation].

=== Shutdown

Shutdown should be handled with care for security reasons. You will need to explicitly enable
that endpoint for it to be usable.

[source, properties]
----
management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true
----

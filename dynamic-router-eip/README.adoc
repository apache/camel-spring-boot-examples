= Camel Dynamic Router EIP Component Spring Boot Examples

This Camel Dynamic Router Spring Boot example module contains applications highlighting the two main use cases
of the Dynamic Router EIP component.

== Single JVM Example

This example shows how you can route messages within a single application, or JVM.

=== Build the Single JVM Example

    mvn clean package -pl :camel-example-spring-boot-dynamic-router-eip-single

=== Run the Single JVM Example

    mvn spring-boot:run -pl :camel-example-spring-boot-dynamic-router-eip-single

==== Access the Swagger UI

Next, point your browser to http://localhost:8080/dynamic-router-example/swagger-ui.html.  Here, you will find
a single endpoint to interact with, called [.olive-background]#/generate#.  Expand the section by clicking on
the colored bar, and click on the `Try it out` button.  There is only one field to fill in, and that is the number
of messages that you want to send through the dynamic router.  Enter a number, and then press the
[.blue-background]#Execute# button.  You will see a `Loading` animation while the messages are being processed.

== Multiple JVM (Multimodule) Example

This example shows how you can route messages between separate modules, where each runs in its own JVM.

=== Build the Multimodule Example

==== For systems with Docker

    mvn clean package -f dynamic-router-eip/dynamic-router-eip-stack -Pdocker

==== For systems with Podman

    mvn clean package -f dynamic-router-eip/dynamic-router-eip-stack -Ppodman

On a system with Podman, your output might resemble the following:

[source,text]
----
Emulate Docker CLI using podman. Create /etc/containers/nodocker to quiet msg.
>>>> Executing external compose provider "/usr/bin/docker compose". Please refer to the documentation for details. <<<<

=== Run the Multimodule Example

When running the application stack for the Multimodule example, it should be the same, whether you have
Docker or Podman installed.  For Podman, please confirm that you have `podman compose` installed to ensure
that you can emulate the Docker CLI when using Podman.

    docker compose -f dynamic-router-eip/dynamic-router-eip-stack/project-resources/docker/compose.yaml up -d

==== Access the Swagger UI

Next, point your browser to http://localhost:8082/main-router/swagger-ui.html.  Here, you will find a few
endpoints to interact with.

===== Generate number messages

The first endpoint is [.olive-background]#/generate#.  Expand the section by clicking on the colored bar, and
click on the `Try it out` button.  There is only one field to fill in, and that is the number of messages that
you want to send through the dynamic router.  Enter a number, and then press the [.blue-background]#Execute#
button.  You will see a `Loading` animation while the messages are being generated.  This will be very brief,
since the message generation happens in its own thread, and everything at this point happens asynchronously.

===== Retrieve number statistics

From the moment messages begin to flow through the system, statistics are compiled.  You can monitor the progress
by using the next endpoint: [.blue-background]#/counts#.  Expand the section by clicking on the colored bar, and
click on the `Try it out` button.  Click the [.blue-background]#Execute# button, and the current statistics will
be displayed.  These will continue to count upward until the current batch of messages has completed.

A run of one million messages might yield output that resembles the following:

[source,json]
----
{
  "all": 1000000,
  "odd": 500000,
  "elapsed seconds": 19,
  "even": 500000
}
----

===== View subscriber information

This endpoint allows you to see the routing participants that have subscribed for dynamic routing.  Expand the
endpoint for [.blue-background]#/list{channel}#.  Clicking the `Try it out` button will allow you to enter the
channel name.  For this example app, you should enter `numbers` in that field, and then click the
[.blue-background]#Execute# button.  The returned text should look like this, although the formatting has been
altered for better documentation clarity:

          headers.command == 'resetStats'}
    ],
    endpoint: kafka://numbers_odd?groupInstanceId=numbers_odd_consumer&headerDeserializer=#stringValueHeaderDeserializer
  ]
]

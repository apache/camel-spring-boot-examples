= FHIR Example - Spring Boot

== Introduction

This is an example application of the `camel-fhir` component. We'll be using `camel-spring-boot` as well for an easy setup.

The Camel route is located in the `MyCamelRouter` class.

This example will read HL7V2 patients from a directory and convert them to FHIR dtsu3 patients and upload them to a configured FHIR server. 

The example installs hapiproject/hapi:v4.2.0 docker image as local FHIR server

By default, the example uses `\http://localhost:8081/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir` as the FHIR server URL, DSTU3 as the FHIR version and `target/work/fhir/input`
as the directory to look for HL7V2 patients.
However, you can edit the `application.properties` file to override the defaults and provide your own configuration.

There is an example of a test in the `MyCamelApplicationTest` class, which mocks out the FHIR server, thus can be run without the FHIR server.

== Build

You can build this example using:

```sh
$ mvn package
```

== Run

Before running your application execute this command to deploy FHIR server:

```
docker run -p 8081:8080 -e HAPI_FHIR_VERSION=DSTU3 -e HAPI_REUSE_CACHED_SEARCH_RESULTS_MILLIS=-1 hapiproject/hapi:v4.2.0
```

Then you can run this example using:

```sh
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

When the Camel application runs, you should see a folder created under `target/work/fhir/input`. Copy the file `hl7v2.patient`
located in the `src/main/data` folder into it. You should see the following output:
```
2018-07-24 11:52:51.615  INFO 30666 --- [work/fhir/input] fhir-example: Converting hl7v2.patient
2018-07-24 11:52:52.700  INFO 30666 --- [work/fhir/input] fhir-example: Inserting Patient: {"resourceType":"Patient","id":"100005056","name":[{"family":"Freeman","given":["Vincent"]}]}

```

The Camel application can be stopped pressing kbd:[Ctrl+c] in the shell.

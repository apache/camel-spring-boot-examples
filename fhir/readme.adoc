= FHIR Example - Spring Boot

== Introduction

This is an example application of the `camel-fhir` component. We'll be using `camel-spring-boot` as well for an easy setup.

The Camel route is located in the `MyCamelRouter` class.

This example will read HL7V2 patients from a directory and convert them to FHIR R4 patients and upload them to a configured FHIR server.

The example installs hapiproject/hapi:v4.2.0 docker image as local FHIR server

By default, the example uses `\http://localhost:8081/fhir` as the FHIR server URL, R4 as the FHIR version and `target/work/fhir/input`
as the directory to look for HL7V2 patients.
However, you can edit the `application.properties` file to override the defaults and provide your own configuration.

There is an example of a test in the `MyCamelApplicationTest` class, which mocks out the FHIR server, thus can be run without the FHIR server.

== Build

You can build this example using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn package
----

== Run

Before running your application execute this command to deploy FHIR server:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 8081:8080 -e hapi.fhir.fhir_version=R4 -e hapi.fhir.reuse_cached_search_results_millis=-1 hapiproject/hapi:v6.8.3
----

Then you can run this example using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

When the Camel application runs, you should see a folder created under `target/work/fhir/input`. Copy the file `hl7v2.patient`
located in the `src/main/data` folder into it. You should see the following output:

[source,text
----
2018-07-24 11:52:51.615  INFO 30666 --- [work/fhir/input] fhir-example: Converting hl7v2.patient

----

The Camel application can be stopped pressing kbd:[Ctrl+c] in the shell.

=== To get health check

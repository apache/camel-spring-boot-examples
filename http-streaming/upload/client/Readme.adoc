== Introduction


This client sends large HTTP data streams to a server to test its ability to handle large data requests.


== Prepare the request data

In the client folder create a large file by running the following command:

	dd if=/dev/zero of=input bs=4M count=1024

The command above creates a 4 Gigabytes file.
You can change the parameters `bs` and `count` to configure the data size.


== Send a request

Use `curl` to send a request:

	curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "data=@./input" http://localhost:8080/test

If you're using the SpringBoot proxy, use the proxy port:

	curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "data=@./input" http://localhost:9000/test


== Clean the data

When you're done, make sure you perform the following actions:
 
1) Delete the large sample data file to clean your filesystem.

2) Delete the output file generated by Camel.

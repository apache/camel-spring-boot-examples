== Spring Boot Widget Gadget Example

=== Introduction

This example demonstrates the widget and gadget example from EIP book, running on Spring Boot.

The example with a similar setup (e.g. without rabbitmq) can be found in this illustration https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/eips/composed-message-processor.html[here]:

=== Configuration

Before the application can run, rabbitmq must be started. This can be done with docker, executing the following command:

[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -d -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 --name my-rabbit rabbitmq:3-management
----

The port can be configured as desired, but do not forget to match the configured port number in your `application.properties`-file!

=== Build

After that, you can build this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ cd spring-boot-widget-gadget
$ mvn package
----

=== Run

You can run this example with Maven using:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

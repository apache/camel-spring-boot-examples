== Camel Health Checks and Spring Boot

This example shows how to work with a simple Apache Camel application using Spring Boot.

NOTE: Some of the routes fail intentionally to have health check monitor their failures

=== How to run

[source,console]
----
mvn compile spring-boot:run
----

=== Health Check

You can query the health check of the application using Spring Boot actuator:

[source,console]
----
$ http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
----

The returned response should include the health checks from Apache Camel,
and as well two custom checks.

== Camel Example OpenAPI Contract First

This example uses Camel to expose REST APIs from an existing OpenAPI specification (contract first).

From the contract we generate Java POJO classes (using maven plugin, see `pom.xml`).

In the Camel route `PetStoreRoute.java` we use Rest DSL using OpenAPI in contract-first mode.
This makes it possible to expose all the APIs very easily, and map this to corresponding Camel
routes via `direct:operationId` naming convention.

The example uses the Petstore OpenAPI example which comes with 18 APIs. This example has only
implemented 2 of these APIs, and to ignore the remaining APIs. This is handy during development,
so you can implement the APIs one by one.

In the `application.properties` we have configured context-path and base-path for the Rest DSL service
which allows us to control this from the properties file, instead of hardcoded values in the spec file (petstore.json).

=== How to run

You can run this example using

    mvn spring-boot:run

=== To call the API

You can call the Rest APIs such as

----
curl http://0.0.0.0:8080/myapp/myapi/pet/123
----

Which returns information about a pet.

You can also update an existing PET such:

----
curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "@daisy.json" http://0.0.0.0:8080/myapp/myapi/pet
----


=== Camel CLI

This application is integrated with the Camel CLI (camel-jbang) via the `camel-cli-connector-starter` dependency (see `pom.xml`).
This allows to use the Camel CLI to manage this application, such as:

    $mvn spring-boot:run

And then use the CLI to see status:

    $camel get
      PID   NAME           CAMEL  PLATFORM            PROFILE  READY  STATUS   RELOAD  AGE  ROUTE  MSG/S  TOTAL  FAIL  INFLIGHT  LAST  DELTA  SINCE-LAST
     87918  CamelPetStore  4.6.0  Spring Boot v3.2.4            1/1   Running       0   7s    3/3   0.00      0     0         0                    -/-/-

To see which Rest APIs that are available in the running Camel application, you can use camel-jbang as follows:

    $camel get platform-http
